# KNN-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify handwritten digits from the sklearn digits dataset. The model is trained on scaled data and tested with different K values to find the best accuracy. It shows how distance-based learning can be used for image classification.
